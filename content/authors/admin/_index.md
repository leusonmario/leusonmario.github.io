I’m a Postdoctoral Fellow at Polytechnique Montreal (Canada) since 2023 working with [Prof. Foutse Khomh](https://khomh.net/). I have a P.h.D. Degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil) under the supervision of [Prof. Paulo Borba](https://pauloborba.cin.ufpe.br/), where I still collaborate on the Software Productivity Group. In my research, I investigate how to support developers on their daily tasks, like when dealing with code integration conflicts (build and test conflicts) and code reviews (SE4AI/AI4SE). My research interests are on Large Language Models, Mining Software Repositories, Collaborative Software Development, Empirical Studies, and Software Evolution.
