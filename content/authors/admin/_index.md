Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Fellow at Polytechnique Montreal since 2023. I have a P.h.D. Degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil), where Iâ€™m a fellow researcher on the Software Productivity Group. In my research, I investigate and develop tools for supporting developers when dealing with code integration conflicts (build and test conflicts). My research interests are on Large Language Models, Mining Software Repositories, Collaborative Software Development, Empirical Studies, and Software Evolution.
